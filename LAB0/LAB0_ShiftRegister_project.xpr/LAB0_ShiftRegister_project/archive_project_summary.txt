---------------------------------
Name      = LAB0_ShiftRegister_project
Directory = /tmp/LAB0_ShiftRegister_project

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the

         accessible. To resolve this issue, please set this property with the desired path
         before launching simulation:-

Property = compxlib.xsim_compiled_library_dir
Path     =
